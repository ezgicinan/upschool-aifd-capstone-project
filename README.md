# AI Interview Assistant âœ¨

This project is an AI-powered interview assistant that generates and evaluates technical interview questions and answers. It leverages Google Gemini AI and Streamlit to provide an interactive interview experience.

This project idea has been on my mind for a while. The education program I attended, UP School AI First Developer program, encuraged me during this time to bring the idea into the world.
I successfully deployed its live version for the first time as a capstone project for AIFD program. ðŸ’ƒðŸ†™
